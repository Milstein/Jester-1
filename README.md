Simple REST tools for JAX-RS and Jersey

If you are about to deploy a JAX-RS REST server with no security at all and you think it is okay because it is just an MVP, PLEASE STOP. Copy the following source over, generate yourself an API KEY and API SECRET and just be done with it. Make sure your clients change their code to use your generated keys with Basic Auth and live will be much better. Should only take a couple of hours at most. 

It may not be the best security but it will be better than going live with nothing.
